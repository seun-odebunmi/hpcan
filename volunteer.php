                                Volunteers in palliative care offer emotional and mental support, friendship, and practical help that substantially
improves the quality of life those living with life-altering ailments as well as their families. The support of volunteers
can also make it more possible for a person to receive care in the comfort of their own home. They are important
members of the palliative care team.
